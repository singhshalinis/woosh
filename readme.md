What is it? (Functionality)
---------------------------
An app to find and save places to your bucket list. It uses Google Maps API to find places, and explore them and finally save the place. The fully functional site will have content relevant to the place from different websites like - Wikipedia, Foursquare using their  APIs. It is being built using Knockout and uses MVVM pattern to make the code more structured and organized.

Code and app coming soon!
